<p>Hi! I'm Adonius McBride,  
    When I was young, I was always the young man filled with happiness, ambition, and a love for technology. You ever wondered, 
    ... "What if a Dinosaur jumped off the empire state biilding onto a pile of trampolines" ...
    Well those were the type of questions I asked. Ever since then my love for technology introduced my thoughts to a library of 
    "what if's" "How's" and "Why's".     
    This is just plain old dummy text until I actually figure out what I want to write about while making the website. </p>
